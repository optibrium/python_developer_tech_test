# Welcome to the Optibrium technical test!

The purpose of this test is to enable candidates to demonstrate some of their python development capabilities.

The test should only take an hour or two.

# The task ... "People and its aliases".

In the same folder as this one you will find an service specification for the Peoples API (People.md).

For this technical test you need to implement a python flask application which implements the specification of the API.

# Administration

Git is an important technology to us. Please push your solution to GitHub and send us a link.

We are interested in your adding your own personal style to the test. Complete it using whatever methodology you want to; however, it is important to note that the code will be reviewed and run by a number of people of varying technical levels, both junior and senior. It is therefore very important that your code is both sufficiently simple.
